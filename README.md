A Unique Virtual Assistant

Building
--------

### Unix

Run this from your terminal:

```
$ git clone "https://github.com/SimpleBinary/pluton.git"
$ cd ./pluton/src
$ cmake .
$ make
```

### Windows

Clone the repo.

Install [MinGW](https://mingw.org) and install the `automake` utilities.

You may also want to consider downloading [CLion](https://jetbrains.com/clion) and choose the `MinGW` template from there.

After that, it makes it a lot easier to build.
