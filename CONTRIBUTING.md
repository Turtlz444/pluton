### Issues

Opening issues if you have found bugs or missing features is an important way of Contributing to Pluton without writing any code. To do this, go to the `Issues` tab and select the required template.

### Pull Requests

If you want to do some programming, you can look for some open Issues and fix them with a Pull Request. It is recommended that you open an Issue first before writing a Pull Request, but is not required.

### Data

If you have some data that would help the Pluton project, feel free to open an Issue and share with us.

Thank you for your cooperation.
